# Car Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook project focuses on predicting car prices based on various features such as the car's age, fuel type, seller type, and transmission type. It employs a Linear Regression model for prediction and includes feature engineering to improve model performance.

## Dataset
The dataset (`cardata.csv`) used in this project contains information about different cars, including their selling price, age, fuel type, seller type, and transmission type.

## Notebooks
- **Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb**: This notebook contains the main code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and feature engineering.

## Dependencies
This project utilizes the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine: `git clone [repository URL]`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd [project directory]`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
2. Open the `Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb` notebook from the project directory.
3. Execute the code cells sequentially to preprocess the data, train the model, perform evaluation, and visualize the results.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the dataset file (`cardata.csv`) is placed in the project directory.
- The notebook includes comments and markdown cells to guide you through each step of the process.
- Feel free to experiment with different models, hyperparameters, or feature engineering techniques to improve performance.
- For any questions or issues, please open a new GitHub issue.
